order service communicates to inventory service synchronoulsy

here will see how to establis this synchronous communication using the library called splring cloud feign

whenver an order service takes a request from client to place an order wil implement a logic to check if the given product
is in stock or not by calling the inventory service

to achieve this synchronous communication, we can use many rest client in spring boot we can use rest template or web client or rest client 
which is the rest client from spring boot 3
we will use spring cloud open feign 

add openfeign library to the order pom.xml, along with this we also need to add the parent version where all the versions of the spring cloud libraries are 
maintained -> we can get this from spring initializr website
add the open feign dependency and dependency management

add @EnableFeignClient annotation to main class in the order services, this annotation will auto configure the necessary classes to use openfeign 

create an interface called inventory client 
annotate this interface with feignclient with values, and in this interface define the methods that we want to be handled by inventory services
and then spring and open feing client will automatically add the necessary implementation to call the inventoruy service using the get method

now we have to call the inventory client from order service

integration testing
we have to mock the interaction to the client, we can do this in 2 ways
1. using mockito -> mocking library that will mock out the interaction to the method so intead of calling the method directly in the inventory client'it 
will just provide a mock respinse that we can use
2. wiremock -> better option, as mockito will just mock but not the acrual testing. wire mock will help with actual http test testing
our order server will call wiremock server and this server will stub the call to the inventory service


add the wire mock dependency to the pom file of oreder service

in orderserviceapplicationtests class to autoconfigure all wiremock related class add @Autoconfigurewiremock annotation

create a class inventoryclientstubs in the package stubs
