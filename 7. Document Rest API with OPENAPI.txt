uisng swagger yo document the rest api -> will document 3 services

open api -> soecification that provides a formal statndard for descrbing http api's


swagger uses open api it like hibernate and jpa relationship

with spring boot we cannot directly use swagger but we ahve to use springdoc-openapi

in product service pom.xml, add the dependency for springdoc openapi=> get it springdoc.org

add the swagger-ui path property to the application.properties file of product-service application

configuring rest api documentstion, create oprnapiconfig class

now will see how to expose rest api documentation with json format
add the dependency for it from springdoc.org

in aplication.properties file add the api docs path property

we can do the same with other 2 order and inventory services ->pending for now
